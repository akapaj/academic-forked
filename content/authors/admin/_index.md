I'm a mathematician, particularly interested in understanding non-equilibrium and living systems. My current focus is in 
quantitative research and building Unsigned Research, a digital-asset management company. 
I was previously an academic, most recently a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, where my primary research 
was in developing interpretable and mathematically robust biophysical models of developing tissues.

I'm available for mathematical consulting in the areas of quantitative research, academia and data science. Please
get in touch below if you'd like to discuss a project.


[//]: # (I am a Herchel Smith Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge. My main interests lie in biomechanics. I use a mixture of mathematical modelling and computational simulations to derive a physical understanding of biological systems. A fundamental aspect of this work is extensive interaction between “wet” and “dry” biologists. Details on specific projects can be found below.)
